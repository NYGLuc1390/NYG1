       <h2 id="New"> New York Giants</h2>
            <p>My favorite football team is the new york giants.
                I started watching football when i was 8.
                The reason i like new york is because when my dad came to the united states he lived in new york.
                When he went to a bar some people gave him a nyg jersey and said he is a new your fan now.

           <h2>EAGLES SUCK</h2>
            <p>I live in philly so its hard being a giants fan.
            Becuase say they lose or have a bad year you get a lot of hate. 
            All i have to say how many superbowls do the eagles have and they shut right up.
